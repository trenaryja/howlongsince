# howlongsince

A GatsbyJS Single Page React Application that tells you "how long since", based on the entered moment in time. Inspired by that question you always ask when you're with friends in a bar. Yes, I know, it's supposed to be "How long has it been since". But that's a mouthful.

# Examples:

-   How long since we discovered pluto? (February 18, 1930)
-   How long since John Denver died (RIP)? (October 12, 1997)
-   How long since the last episode of the original X-files (May 19, 2002)
-   How long since Chernobyl exploded (April 26, 1986, 1:23:58 a.m. EEST)
-   How long since double finger guns was cool (February 30, 1969)

# Goals

-   Build Form to capture user submitted ideas for ratios/measurements
-   Time Zone/Location picker
-   Bundle as npm package, for a dependancy free library that can be used in other javascript packages (You could just use a real datetime library, but if this works for you awesome. Please let me know!)
